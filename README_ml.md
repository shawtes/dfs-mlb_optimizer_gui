Abstract 
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to constructing optimized MLB Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) lineups by leveraging advanced ensemble learning techniques and feature engineering. We provide a detailed mathematical formulation for the methods used in the Python script, explaining the statistical concepts, ensemble model architecture, and evaluation metrics. This paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematical principles and their practical application in DFS lineup optimization.
 
1. Introduction
The rise of Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) has led to the development of sophisticated algorithms for lineup optimization. This paper focuses on optimizing MLB DFS lineups using advanced machine learning models, feature engineering, and statistical analysis. We detail the mathematical theories behind these techniques and demonstrate their practical application through Python code.
Problem Statement: The primary goal is to construct a lineup that maximizes expected fantasy points while adhering to the constraints of DFS contests. This problem can be modeled using mathematical optimization, where the objective is to maximize the value of the lineup based on predicted player performance.
 
2. Mathematical Formulation of Key Metrics
2.1 Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA)
wOBA is a sabermetric statistic that measures a player's overall offensive contributions per plate appearance. The formula for wOBA is:
wOBA=wBB×BB+wHBP×HBP+w1B×1B+w2B×2B+w3B×3B+wHR×HRAB+BB−IBB+SF+HBPwOBA=AB+BB−IBB+SF+HBPwBB×BB+wHBP×HBP+w1B×1B+w2B×2B+w3B×3B+wHR×HR
Where:
•	wBB,wHBP,w1B,w2B,w3B,wHRwBB,wHBP,w1B,w2B,w3B,wHR are the year-specific weights for each event.
•	ABAB is at-bats, BBBB is walks, HBPHBP is hit-by-pitch, 1B1B is singles, 2B2B is doubles, 3B3B is triples, HRHR is home runs, IBBIBB is intentional walks, and SFSF is sacrifice flies.
2.2 Slugging Percentage (SLG)
SLG measures a player's power by calculating the total number of bases a player records per at-bat. The formula is:
SLG=1B+2×2B+3×3B+4×HRABSLG=AB1B+2×2B+3×3B+4×HR
This statistic provides insight into a player’s ability to generate extra-base hits, which is crucial for predicting their fantasy performance.
2.3 Runs Above Replacement (RAR)
RAR estimates the number of runs a player contributes above a replacement-level player. It is calculated using WAR (Wins Above Replacement):
RAR=WAR×RUNS_PER_WINRAR=WAR×RUNS_PER_WIN
In the provided script, RUNS_PER_WIN is assumed to be 10, reflecting the average number of runs per win.
2.4 WAR to Dollar Conversion
To translate WAR into a monetary value, we use:
Dollars=WAR×Conversion FactorDollars=WAR×Conversion Factor
Where the Conversion Factor is typically around 8 (representing $8 million per WAR), as used in the script. This conversion helps in understanding a player’s economic value to the team.
2.5 Expected Runs Created (wRC)
wRC estimates the number of runs a player contributes to their team. The formula is:
wRC=wRAA+(AB×RUNS_PER_PA)wRC=wRAA+(AB×RUNS_PER_PA)
Where RUNS_PER_PA is assumed to be a constant (e.g., 0.1) for simplification.
2.6 Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP)
BABIP measures how often a ball in play results in a hit, ignoring home runs. It is calculated as:
BABIP=H−HRAB−SO−HR+SFBABIP=AB−SO−HR+SFH−HR
This metric helps in assessing a player’s hitting performance independent of home runs.
2.7 Rolling and Lagging Features
The script computes rolling and lagging statistics to capture short-term trends in player performance. For example, the 7-day rolling average for fantasy points is:
Rolling_Mean7=17∑i=17DK_FPTSt−iRolling_Mean7=71i=1∑7DK_FPTSt−i
Where DK_FPTSt−iDK_FPTSt−i represents the fantasy points scored on day t−it−i.
 
3. Ensemble Modeling: Theory and Implementation
3.1 Stacking and Voting Regressors
Stacking Regressor: Stacking combines multiple base models to improve prediction accuracy. The mathematical formulation for stacking is:
y^=α1⋅y^1+α2⋅y^2+⋯+αn⋅y^ny^=α1⋅y^1+α2⋅y^2+⋯+αn⋅y^n
Where y^iy^i are the predictions from each base model, and αiαi are the weights assigned by the meta-model.
Voting Regressor: Voting aggregates predictions by averaging:
y^voting=1n∑i=1ny^iy^voting=n1i=1∑ny^i
Where y^iy^i are the predictions from the individual models.
3.2 Meta-Model Selection
In the script, XGBoost is used as the meta-model in the stacking regressor. XGBoost optimizes a regularized objective function:
L(θ)=∑i=1nl(yi,y^i)+∑k=1KΩ(fk)L(θ)=i=1∑nl(yi,y^i)+k=1∑KΩ(fk)
Where ll is the loss function, Ω(fk)Ω(fk) is the regularization term for tree fkfk, and θθ represents the model parameters.
 
4. Time Series Cross-Validation
The script employs TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation. Unlike traditional cross-validation, this method maintains the temporal ordering of data, which is crucial in time-dependent problems like DFS.
Let T1,T2,…,TkT1,T2,…,Tk be the time series splits. The model is trained on T1,…,Tk−1T1,…,Tk−1 and validated on TkTk. The performance metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, R2) are computed for each split.
MAE=1n∑i=1n∣yi−y^i∣MAE=n1i=1∑n∣yi−y^i∣MSE=1n∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2MSE=n1i=1∑n(yi−y^i)2R2=1−∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2∑i=1n(yi−yˉ)2R2=1−∑i=1n(yi−yˉ)2∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2
 
5. Multiprocessing and Feature Engineering
The script uses multiprocessing to handle large datasets efficiently. The data is split into chunks, and each chunk is processed concurrently, leveraging the ProcessPoolExecutor.
Mathematical Concept: Multiprocessing can be viewed as parallel computation, where each processor performs a subset of operations independently:
Total Time=max⁡(Timei)∀i∈processorsTotal Time=max(Timei)∀i∈processors
Feature engineering creates new variables (e.g., lagged features, rolling statistics) that provide additional insights into player performance. These features are then passed through the preprocessing pipeline for standardization and transformation.
 
6. Evaluation and Feature Importance
Evaluation Metrics: The script uses MAE, MSE, R2, and MAPE to evaluate model performance. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
Feature Importance: The importance of each feature is assessed using the feature importance from the XGBoost model:
Importance(fj)=∑t=1Tγt(fj)Importance(fj)=t=1∑Tγt(fj)
Where γt(fj)γt(fj) is the importance of feature fjfj in tree tt.
 
7. Conclusion
This paper provides a detailed explanation of the Python script used for MLB DFS lineup optimization. By integrating mathematical theories and practical implementations, we demonstrate the power of machine learning and feature engineering in solving complex optimization problems in DFS. Future work could explore more sophisticated models and optimization techniques to further enhance lineup performance.

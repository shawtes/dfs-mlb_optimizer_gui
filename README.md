Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing and predicting player performance in Major League Baseball (MLB) Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests. The focus is twofold: a combinatorial optimization strategy for constructing effective lineups and a machine learning pipeline leveraging advanced feature engineering and ensemble models. The optimization problem tackles the combinatorial challenges of selecting a roster that satisfies budget and position constraints while maximizing expected points. On the prediction side, time-series analysis, feature engineering, and stacking regressors contribute to a robust model for forecasting player fantasy points. The approach is evaluated in the context of daily contests with top-heavy payoff structures, where diversification, variance management, and stacking strategies are crucial.
 
1. Introduction
Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) have emerged as a popular format in which participants compete by selecting lineups composed of real-world athletes, earning points based on their actual performance. In MLB DFS, the objective is to create an optimal lineup while adhering to budgetary and positional constraints. This paper addresses the dual challenges of optimizing lineups using combinatorial optimization techniques and predicting player performance using machine learning models. The aim is to maximize the probability of achieving top-tier finishes in contests with top-heavy payout structures.
 
2. Problem Formulation
The optimization challenge in MLB DFS involves selecting a lineup that maximizes expected points while satisfying constraints such as salary caps and position limits. Each player has an associated cost and positional eligibility. The problem is analogous to combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to maximize a submodular objective function similar to portfolio optimization:
maximize ∑i=1nf(xi)subject to: ∑i=1ncixi≤B,∑i=1nxi position constraints,xi∈{0,1},maximize i=1∑nf(xi)subject to: i=1∑ncixi≤B,i=1∑nxi position constraints,xi∈{0,1},
where:
•	f(xi)  represents the expected fantasy points for player i.
•	Ci is the cost (salary) of player i.
•	B is the budget constraint (e.g., $50,000).
•	Positional constraints include roster restrictions like having exactly one pitcher (P), one catcher (C), etc.
This formulation is a variant of a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), seeking to maximize a submodular objective function under budget and position constraints.
 
3. Model Overview
3.1. Machine Learning Pipeline
The machine learning pipeline employs advanced feature engineering, ensemble models, and time-series forecasting. Models like Ridge Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting are stacked using an XGBoost meta-model. Feature selection is achieved using Select K Best with the f-regression scoring metric.
3.2. Optimization Techniques
The combinatorial optimization problem is modeled as an MILP where the objective is to maximize total projected points subject to constraints on player positions and salary. The model prioritizes diversification by considering the variance and correlation between players' performances.
 
4. Feature Engineering and Time-Series Analysis
The feature engineering process involves creating lag features, rolling statistics, and advanced sabermetric metrics like wOBA, BABIP, and SIERA. These features capture temporal dynamics and enhance the model’s ability to predict future performance. Additionally, synthetic data generation is used to improve the robustness of predictions.
 
5. UI Design for DFS Optimization
The user interface (UI) for the optimization tool is built using PyQt5, allowing users to load player data, configure settings, and run simulations. The UI supports advanced features like customizable stack exposures and contest-specific parameters, designed to facilitate real-time updates and lineup adjustments.
 
6. Stack Strategies and Contest-Specific Approaches
In top-heavy contests, stacking strategies are key to success. By focusing on correlated performances—such as stacking hitters from the same team—the approach maximizes the likelihood of capturing high-scoring events. The combinatorial optimization model accommodates these strategies by adjusting constraints and objectives based on contest type.
 
7. Evaluation and Results
The proposed models and optimization strategies were evaluated using historical DFS contest data. Results demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy and contest outcomes. Notably, synthetic data generation and advanced stacking strategies led to significant improvements in overall performance.
 
8. Conclusion
This paper presents a novel approach to MLB DFS optimization and prediction, combining advanced machine learning techniques with combinatorial optimization. The integration of time-series analysis, feature engineering, and stacking strategies leads to robust performance in real-world contests. Future work will explore more sophisticated optimization algorithms and real-time prediction adjustments.
 
9. Mathematical Formulation of Lineup Optimization
The lineup generation problem is a multi-objective optimization problem where we aim to maximize expected points while balancing variance, correlation, and stack strategies. The problem is formulated as:
maximize ∑p=1Nfpxpsubject to: ∑p=1Ncpxp≤B,∑p=1Nxp satisfies positional constraints,xp∈{0,1}.maximize p=1∑Nfpxpsubject to: p=1∑Ncpxp≤B,p=1∑Nxp satisfies positional constraints,xp∈{0,1}.
Where:
•	fp represents the projected fantasy points for player pp.
•	cp is the salary for player p.
•	xp is a binary decision variable indicating whether player p is selected.
Advanced constraints consider real-world factors like variance reduction, diversification, and team stack preferences, optimizing for diversity across multiple lineups.
 
10. Monte Carlo Simulations and Stochastic Optimization
Monte Carlo methods generate scenario-based projections for player performance. The expectation over stochastic variables is integrated into the optimization model as:
E[f(x)]=∫Θf(x,θ)p(θ)dθ,E[f(x)]=∫Θf(x,θ)p(θ)dθ,
where θ represents stochastic variations in player performance. This probabilistic approach models uncertainty in player projections, allowing for a distribution of possible outcomes.
 
11. Feature Engineering and Advanced Sabermetrics
•	Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA):
wOBA=∑i(Weighti×Outcomei)Plate Appearances,wOBA=Plate Appearances∑i(Weighti×Outcomei),
where each outcome (e.g., single, double, home run) is assigned a weight based on its contribution to scoring.
•	Isolated Power (ISO):
ISO=SLG−AVG,ISO=SLG−AVG,
where SLG (slugging percentage) and AVG (batting average) are standard baseball metrics.
•	Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP):
FIP=13×HR+3×(BB+HBP)−2×KIP+3.1,FIP=IP13×HR+3×(BB+HBP)−2×K+3.1,
where HR, BB, HBP, and K represent home runs, walks, hit by pitches, and strikeouts, respectively.
 
12. Machine Learning Models: Mathematical Foundations
•	Ridge Regression: Ridge regression introduces L2 regularization:
minw∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2+λ∑j=1pwj2.minwi=1∑n(yi−y^i)2+λj=1∑pwj2.
•	Lasso Regression: Lasso regression incorporates L1 regularization:
minw∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2+λ∑j=1p∣wj∣.minwi=1∑n(yi−y^i)2+λj=1∑p∣wj∣.
•	Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is based on minimizing an error function with a margin of tolerance ϵϵ:
minw,b,ξ12∥w∥2+C∑i=1nξi,minw,b,ξ21∥w∥2+Ci=1∑nξi,
subject to:
yi−⟨w,xi⟩−b≤ϵ+ξi and ⟨w,xi⟩+b−yi≤ϵ+ξi.yi−⟨w,xi⟩−b≤ϵ+ξi and ⟨w,xi⟩+b−yi≤ϵ+ξi.
 
13. Optimization Problem Formulation: Integer Programming and Heuristic Approaches
•	Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP):
min∑p=1Ncpxp+∑j=1mλjgj(x),minp=1∑Ncpxp+j=1∑mλjgj(x),
where gj(x)gj(x) represents penalties for constraint violations.
•	Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): MCTS explores lineup combinations using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula:
UCB=Q^(s,a)+cln⁡N(s)N(s,a),UCB=Q^(s,a)+cN(s,a)lnN(s),
where Q^(s,a)Q^(s,a) is the expected reward, N(s)N(s) is the number of visits to state ss, and N(s,a)N(s,a) is the number of times action aa has been taken from state ss.
 
14. Advanced Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
•	SelectKBest and ANOVA F-Statistics:
Feature selection is performed by ranking features based on their ANOVA FF-scores:
F=between-group variabilitywithin-group variability.F=within-group variabilitybetween-group variability.
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Z=XW,Z=XW,
where Z represents the transformed data, X is the original dataset, and W contains the eigenvectors.
 
15. Rolling Predictions and Time-Series Modeling
•	Recursive Forecasting: Rolling predictions involve training on a window of historical data:
yt+1=f(yt,yt−1,…,yt−p),yt+1=f(yt,yt−1,…,yt−p),
where p is the lag window size.
•	Evaluation Metrics: Metrics include:
o	R2R2
o	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
o	Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE):
RMSLE=1n∑i=1n(log⁡(1+y^i)−log⁡(1+yi))2.RMSLE=n1i=1∑n(log(1+y^i)−log(1+yi))2.
 
16. Integration of Optimization and Machine Learning
The optimization and machine learning components work together by using model predictions as inputs into the optimization problem. The pipeline is mathematically represented as:
y^=g(f(X;θ1);θ2),y^=g(f(X;θ1);θ2),
where f represents feature transformations and g represents the final predictive model.
 
17. Results and Comparative Analysis
The evaluation process involves cross-validation strategies (k-fold, stratified sampling) to ensure model robustness. Performance metrics include:
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
•	R2R2
•	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
